# BTC and S&P 500 Tracking
A tracking repository of BTC and S&amp;P500 data, and scripts for using said data.

BTC history accurate to 09-2025. SP500 accurate to 08-2025
BTC is to the dollar, sourced from BITSTAMP at [Trading View](https://www.tradingview.com). Current month is never included.
S&P500 is currently sourced from [in2013dollars](https://www.in2013dollars.com/us-economy/s-p-500-price), and contains the monthly data going back to 1971. Most recent entry may be inaccurate.
Current update for both is manual.

Scripts are semi-functional, but intially AI work and poorly planned.

##TODO
- Implement an automated data collection.
- Update scripts to account for better workflow.
- Refactor
